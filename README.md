# Digital Resume Website

This is my digital resume site. I pulled every detail straight from my PDF resume and turned it into a clean single-page website so it looks great on desktop and mobile.

## What I Used
- HTML5 for the structure
- CSS3 for all the styling and the two-column layout
- Google Fonts (Poppins) + Font Awesome icons for the finishing touches

## What’s Inside
- **Contact** – mail, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub
- **Skills** – the tech stack I work with (Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Education** – B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML) with CGPA, plus Class X & XII details
- **Projects** – my Video Conferencing App and Music Streaming Web App
- **Experience** – internships at Dataspace Academy, Edulyt India, and WEBEL
- **Certifications & Hobbies** – Coursera Digital Transformation with Google Cloud and my love for reading story books

## How to View It
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser.
3. If you want live reload, open the folder in VS Code and run Live Server.

## Customizing For Yourself
Open `index.html` to change any text. The theme colors live inside the `:root` section in `style.css` if you want to swap palettes. Keep the structure the same so the layout stays intact.
